# My Study Buddy

Busy students often forget to take care of themselves while studying hard. My Study Buddy is a Chrome extension that allows users to choose what pre-set study break types to be reminded of (hydrate, eat snack, or stretch), set their own reminders, and block distracting sites. You may also choose between 3 hand-drawn study buddies!
