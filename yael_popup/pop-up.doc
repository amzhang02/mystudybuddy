Hi I just wanted to make a quick notes place
specifically in here so we could all see it.

Basically I realized I can't put comments in json files
and it would be really useful to have some comments on it right now.

Within the "action" part in json, we can put 
    "default_icon": { *put in png files!* },
    once we have an icon design

taken out of manifest, may be needed later:
"background": {
        "service_worker": "popup.js",
        "type": "module"
    },
