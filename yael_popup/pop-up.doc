Hi I just wanted to make a quick notes place
specifically in here so we could all see it.

Basically I realized I can't put comments in json files
and it would be really useful to have some comments on it right now.

We can totally delete this file later, no problem,
I just wanted to put this idea in place before I forgot it:
I think we can start the website blocking feature in the json file 
through the content_scripts part, since it seems to be websites we 
would have access to in the extension and what to do with them! I 
think this could work, and I didn't want to forget it :P

Within the "action" part in json, we can put 
    "default_icon": { *put in png files!* },
    once we have an icon design
